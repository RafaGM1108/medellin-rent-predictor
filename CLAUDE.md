## Conventions

### Workflow

1. Work is tracked in the GitHub Project linked to this repo. Status columns: Backlog,
   Ready, In Progress, In Review, Done. WIP limit: at most 2 items In Progress.
2. Each roadmap phase is a GitHub Milestone ("Phase N - <name>"). Each phase is broken
   into small issues (half a day to two days of work), each with a type label, milestone,
   Priority and Size, and added to the project.
3. Before starting an issue: move it to In Progress and create branch
   `<type>/<issue-number>-<short-slug>` from an updated `main` (e.g., `feat/12-rent-scraper`).
4. When finished: run `make lint typecheck test`, update `CHANGELOG.md`, open a PR that
   says "Closes #<issue>", move the issue to In Review, then STOP, summarize the changes,
   and wait for my approval.
5. After approval: merge with a merge commit (never squash) so individual commits are
   preserved on `main`. Merged branches are deleted automatically. Never delete unmerged
   branches.
6. Extra work, bugs or ideas found along the way are not done silently: create a new issue
   in Backlog.
7. When every issue of a milestone is Done, close the milestone and create the tag/release
   if the roadmap says so.

### Code and data

8. Small commits with conventional commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`,
   `refactor:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `data:`).
9. Dependencies only via `uv add` (dev tools with `--group dev`).
10. Reusable logic lives in `src/`; notebooks are for exploration and narrative and import
    from `src/`.
11. Type hints and docstrings on all public functions; tests for every `src` module; target
    coverage >= 80%.
12. Everything in English: code, comments, docs, README, commits.
13. NEVER invent results. Every metric, number, or figure in the README must come from an
    actual run, saved in `data/08_reporting` (metrics as JSON/CSV, figures as PNG).
14. Data ethics: scraping only if robots.txt and terms of use allow it, with rate limiting
    and an identified user agent; never collect or publish personal data; do not commit
    data whose license forbids redistribution (commit the code plus a small sample
    instead); secrets only in `.env`, never committed (provide `.env.example`).
